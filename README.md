# Generics in Java Programming (Generic Programming)

- Generics basically means _parameterized types_.
- _Parameterized types_ are important because we can create
    - classes
    - interfaces, and
    - methods  
in which the type of the data which we want to operate on is 
specified as a parameter.
- Using `Generics` it is possible to create a single class, that can 
work with a lot of different types of data.
A class, that operates on _parameterized types_ is called a `Generic Class`.

## Points about Generic Programming

1. Generics only work with a reference type.
